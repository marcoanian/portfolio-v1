<h1>Python Calculator Project</h1>
<h3>by Marco A.</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The Python Calculator Project was one of my first complex projects.<br/>
Not because of the setup or the GUI, but rather due to the challenge<br/> 
of processing and calculating data. Since this project utilizes the eval()<br/> 
function, I had to implement additional input validation, error handling,<br/> 
and security mechanisms to prevent potential attacks on the user's system. </p>

<h3>2. Processing the Calculation </h3>
<p>Once the calculation is processed, the user is given the option to<br/>
continue using the last result.</p>
