<h1>Python Json Writer Project</h1>
<h3>by Marco A.</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The JSON Writer Project was born out of my need to <br/>
create my own JSON files from study lectures that I had to learn.<br/>
Since I wanted a Q&A tool, I first had to extract text from <br/>
PDFs and then import the processed data into my tool.<br/>

<h3>1. Launching the JSON Writer</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Load Source Data (must be a .txt file).</li>
    <li>Choose a Key (important to know whether it's a Flat or Nested structure). </li>
    <li>General Key Selection – If using a Nested JSON structure, subkeys must be assigned accordingly.</li>
    <li>Press the Save Button – This adds the key/value pair to a dictionary.</li>
    <li>Final Step – Once the user is ready, save the file as a .json file. (Users can check the format before saving).</li>
</ol>
